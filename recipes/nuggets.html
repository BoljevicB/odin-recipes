    <p>Simple, super easy and delicious!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>¼ cup ranch dressing</li>
    <li>⅔ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>⅔ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>step</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place a wire cooling rack on top and spray with cooking spray.</p>
        <li>step</li>
        <p>Put chicken into a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add ranch dressing; seal and shake bag to coat chicken evenly.</p>
        <li>step</li>
        <p>Mix panko, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and parsley together in a bowl; pour into bag with chicken. Seal and shake bag to coat thoroughly. Remove from bag; place on rack in a single layer.</p>
        <li>step</li>
        <p>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</p>
        <li>step</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Turn broiler on high; broil until crispy, about 1 minute.</p>
    </ol>
